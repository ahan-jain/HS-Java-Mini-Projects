# HS-Java-Mini-Projects
Projects that I made in high school because I found them quite interesting.

Banking_System: A banking system that stores the name, deposits and withdrawals of a user who just signed up. In case they want to access their previous transaction, they can see a .txt file that is automatically created with their name as the name of the .txt file, which keeps a log of all their transactions. they can check their deposit at any time and exit once they're done.

Caesar_Cipher: A cipher which encrypts any sentence according to a numeric key, more commonlu known as the Caesar Cipher.

English_to_PigLatin: A program which acts as an English to PigLatin translator.

Mad_Libs: An interactive Mad Libs project which asks the user to enter a series of nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. to create an out-of-context funny paragraph.

Pet_care: A program which has 3 pets in a dictionary (a cat, dog and rat) which act as pets. You can choose to play with them, put them to bed, and feed them, which affects their physical and mental attributes, as shown by the terminal as the program executes.
